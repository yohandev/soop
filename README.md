# soop
simple object oriented programming

# future plans
blocks
    + broadcast(object) - allows you to broadcast objects rather than data-less events
    + typeof(object) - get the type of a variable, presented as a string. synthesizes with broadcast object
    + new(type v) - the classic new operator, with a dropdown for all class types in the project
    + destroy(type v) - explicitely destroy a sprite. interaction with object base class?
paradigms
    + default base class: sprite - provides most scratch blocks and is added to active scene automatically
    + lowest base class: object - for more advanced users
    + another base class: scene - allows you to control the scene
