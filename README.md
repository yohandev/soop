a few things:
there's still bugs :( but the project is usable as far as that goes. The most important thing to note is that you can't drag-out blocks from the 'palette' on the left, as you'd expect. Instead, click them once(or more if the event didn't register) and a copy of that block will appear in the center of your screen.
